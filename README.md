🌷 Tulip – A Personal AI Assistant (In Progress)
  ->Tulip is an experimental AI assistant project inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man. I'm currently building it as part of my journey as a Data Science master's student to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning through hands-on experience.

📌 Project Status
  ->🚧 Work in Progress
    -->This project is in its early stages. I'm exploring concepts like natural language processing, automation, and intelligent task handling. As I learn and grow, Tulip will evolve too.

🎯 Goals
  ->Learn and apply AI/ML techniques in a practical setting,
  ->Build an assistant that can understand natural language,
  ->Explore voice control, API integration, and automation,
  ->Create a modular, extensible architecture.

🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned / Experimenting With)
  ->Python 3,
  ->NLP with libraries like spaCy, transformers, or NLTK,
  ->Voice input/output with speech_recognition and pyttsx3,
  ->APIs for weather, reminders, search, etc.
  ->Possibly OpenAI GPT or similar LLMs (as I learn more).

🙋‍♂️ About Me
  ->I'm a Master's student in Data Science with a passion for AI and ML. Tulip is a passion project to apply what I'm learning and to explore the possibilities of intelligent systems in the real world.

📚 Coming Soon
  ->Core functionality (basic commands and responses),
  ->Voice interaction,
  ->API integrations,
  ->Modular design for extending features easily.

🤝 Contributions
  ->Not accepting contributions yet — this is currently a personal learning project. I’ll open it up once it’s in a more stable state.

📜 License
  This project will be open-source once I’ve completed the basic functionality.
